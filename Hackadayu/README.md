# Introduction to Reverse Engineering with Ghidra
Using the publicly available HackadayU course to familiarize myself with Ghidra. This is a four session course that covers the basics of reverse engineering software with Ghidra. For each session there are exercises to be completed that can be found on the project github page.

1. Session One Lecture
2. Session Two Lecture
3. Session Three Lecture
4. Session Four Lecture

Exercises and materials can be found here.

## Course Goals
- Familiarize students with the basic concepts behind software reverse engineering
- x86_64 Architecture Review
- Identifying C constructs in assembly code
- Disassembly vs Decompilation
- Teach students how to use the Ghidra SRE tool to reverse engineer Linux based binaries
- Basic navigation and usage
- How to identify and reconstruct structures, local variables and other program components
- Demonstrate and explain the methodologies used when approaching an unknown program with Ghidra
- Where to start when looking at an unknown binary
- How to quickly gain an understanding of an unknown program
- Provide challenges and "crackme" exercises so that students gain hands on experience with Ghidra
