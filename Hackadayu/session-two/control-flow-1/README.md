# Control Flow
For this challenge we were to:
- find the number of compare statements in main, 
- what the three values being compared are, 
- and see if it is possible to pass all the checks. 

## Fixing syntax
For this session we learned that we can modify a functions signature, and how this could improve the decompiled C-code. 
For this challenge I changed the main function signature from ```undefined8 main(int param_1,long param_2)``` to ```int main(int argc,char **argv)```. 
This way it is defined with the C-standard argument counter ```int argc``` and argument vector ```char **argv```.

BEFORE CHANGE
```
undefined8 main(int param_1,long param_2)

{
  int iVar1;
  int iVar2;
  undefined8 uVar3;
  
  if (param_1 == 3) {
    iVar1 = atoi(*(char **)(param_2 + 8));
    iVar2 = atoi(*(char **)(param_2 + 0x10));
    if (iVar2 < iVar1) {
      if (iVar2 << 1 < iVar1) {
...
```
AFTER CHANGE
```
int main(int argc,char **argv)

{
  int iVar1;
  int iVar2;
  
  if (argc == 3) {
    iVar1 = atoi(argv[1]);
    iVar2 = atoi(argv[2]);
    if (iVar2 < iVar1) {
      if (iVar2 << 1 < iVar1) {
...
```
## Number of compare statements
There are 4 compares in total:
```        
00100699 83 7d ec 03     CMP        dword ptr [RBP + local_1c],0x3
0010069d 74 16           JZ         cmpOneOK
```
The first compares the ```argc``` variable which is stored at ```RBP + local_1c``` with 3. Meaning that we have to provide 2 arguments for the program to pass (given by ```JZ```). 
```       
001006ec 8b 45 f4        MOV        EAX,dword ptr [RBP + local_14]
001006ef 3b 45 f8        CMP        EAX,dword ptr [RBP + local_10]
001006f2 7f 13           JG         cmpTwoOK
```
The second compares the argument stored at ```RBP + local_14``` with the argument stored at ```RBP + local_10``` and checks if the result is greater than. The values that are compared here are the results of ```atoi``` functions. ```int atoi(const char *str)``` converts the string argument ```str``` to an integer (type int).
```
0010070d 3b 45 f4        CMP        EAX,dword ptr [RBP + local_14]
00100710 7d 13           JGE        cmpThreeOK
```
The third compares the the stored variable at ```RBP + local_10```, which has been left-shifted once, with the variable stored at ```RBP + local_14```. If the result is greater than or equal, it goes to the last check.
```
0010072b 83 f8 63        CMP        EAX,0x63
0010072e 7f 13           JG         cmpFourOK=SUCCESS
```
The fourth compares the value stored in ```EAX``` to ```0x63/99/c/1100011```. The values is the result of the addition of the values at address ```RBP + local_14``` and ```RBP + local_10```;```RBP + local_14``` is subtracted from the value and stored into ```EAX``` before the comparison. If the result is greater than the program will call the success string. 

## Passing all the checks
The fourth check has to have the value ```99``` in order to pass. It is var2 + var1 - var1 = var1

The third check has to have the var2 leftshifted once be greater than or equal var1.

The second check has to have the var1 greater than var2. 

The first check has to have the program executed with two arguments.
