# Session 2 Outline: C to ASM
- Ghidra tips
- Control flow review
- Function calls
- Loops and iterators
- Switch statements
- Local and global variables
- Array access and manipulation

## Session Exercises
These exercises are designed to illusrate the principals that are covered in the course materials, for session two we have the following exercises:
- control-flow-1
- loop-example-1
- variables-example
- func-example-1
- array-example

Note: You will need to mark these binaries as executable before trying to run them, ex: ```chmod u+x control-flow-1``` 

Each of these exercises are designed to accept user input from the command line - when the proper input is provided you will get a Success or Congratulatory message.

For example, ```control-flow-1``` takes two values as an input, so you would run it as: ```./control-flow-1 value1 value2```
