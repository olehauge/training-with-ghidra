# Scripting / API Review
In this folder you will find three examples of the same code compiled for different architectures. For each of these, see if you can do the following:

1. Write a Java script that calculates instruction frequency for all of the instructions used in the main function
2. Write a Python script to examine and write the PCode out to a file using the API calls covered in class
3. Write a Java or Python script that counts the amount of branches taken during the main function
