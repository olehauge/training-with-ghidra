# Files
For this challenge we were to:
- What is the difference between this exercise and the struct and pointer exercises?
- What file operations are being performed?
- Find the password.

## Initial analysis
I expect the the program to open, read and use the data stored in files to create a password template (using XOR operations) and compare it to the supplied values. 
The program looks for 3 files: `key.y`, `uname.x`, and `pword.z` which have contain a set minimum of values. 
These values are then used by the program.
The program will fail if these files does not exist, if they are empty, and if the supplied values are wrong. 

```
int open(char * __file, int __oflag, ...)

int               EAX:4          <RETURN>
char *            RDI:8          __file
int               ESI:4          __oflag
```
rsi set to 0x0

rdi set to string: `key.y`

eax set to 0x0 (cleared for the return value). The return value of open() is a file descriptor.

```
ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);

ssize_t           RAX:8          <RETURN>
int               EDI:4          __fd
void *            RSI:8          __buf
size_t            RDX:8          __nbytes
```
rsi set to `rcx` = `[RBP + -0x6c]`

rdi set to `eax` = `dword ptr [RBP + open_returnValue]`

edx set to `0x4`

rax: On success, the number of bytes read is returned.

```
int open(char * __file, int __oflag, ...)

int               EAX:4          <RETURN>
char *            RDI:8          __file
int               ESI:4          __oflag
```
rsi set to 0x0

rdi set to string: `uname.x`

eax set to 0x0 (cleared for the return value). The return value of open() is a file descriptor.

```
ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);

void *            RSI:8          __buf
size_t            RDX:8          __nbytes
```
rsi set to `rcx` = `qword ptr [RBP + heapAddress]`

rdi set to `eax` = `dword ptr [RBP + open2_returnValue]`

edx set to `0x255`

rax: On success, the number of bytes read is returned.

```
int open(char * __file, int __oflag, ...)

int               EAX:4          <RETURN>
char *            RDI:8          __file
int               ESI:4          __oflag
```

void *            RSI:8          __buf
size_t            RDX:8          __nbytes
```
rsi set to `rcx` = `qword ptr [RBP + heapAddress2]`

rdi set to `eax` = `dword ptr [RBP + open3_returnValue]`

edx set to `0x255`

rax: On success, the number of bytes read is returned.

## Testing the program
Testing the program confirms my hypothesis.

Invalid character in password detected, exiting now!
`
What remains know is to reverse the `gen_password` function in order to supply the correct values in the files.

## NOTES
Stores the value in `argc` into the memory location pointed to by `RBP + stored_argc`.
```
MOV        dword ptr [RBP + stored_argc],argc(rdi)
```
The lea instruction places the address specified by its first operand into the register specified by its second operand.
```
LEA        RCX,[RBP + -0x6c]
```
